# ScrollSenseTBII

This repository contains Robin Paul Tech Basics II Exam Project code!
<br/>
ScrollSense is an App Concept, that I created for a University Project.
The idea behind the App is that I have caught myself with the bad habit 
of mindlessly opening social media apps and then getting stuck in them.
With ScollSense I wanted to create a solution for that problem! <br/>
My application opens simultaniously when you try to open a social media
app like e.g. Instagram, it then asks you whether you really want to open
the app and provides you with some statisctics to lessen your screen time
and usage. <br/>
It should therefore help you improving your habits.
